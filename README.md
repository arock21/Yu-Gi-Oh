## ðŸ“ƒ Rules ðŸ“ƒ
Rules of engangement go as followes:
 1. Players first select their names.
 2. A coin is tossed and the order of the players is dictated.
 3. Players are given 5 cards from a _stack_ of cards.
 4. Players decide which cards to place in their attack and defense _queues_.
 5. Cards are _dequeued_ from _queues_. If attack is greater than the defense of another card, the remaining dammage is delt on the player.
 6. Repeat step 4 and 5 until a player dies.
